        <p>I am attending this class to learn about web and app development but I see now that it will just be a check in the box. 
        I will have to look for other resources in order to learn about web and app development even though I have created websites from scratch on my own
        and even created a website for flipping real estate on my own with zero html 5 and CSS knowledge.</p>
